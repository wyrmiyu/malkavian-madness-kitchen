== Instructions

[font="Bitstream Vera Sans",size="11pt"]
. **Preheat the oven**
  .. Preheat your oven to 180°C.
  .. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

. **Cream the wet Ingredients**
  .. In a large bowl, cream the vegan butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until smooth and fluffy.
  .. Mix in the vanilla extract and plant-based milk.

. **Mix the dry ingredients**
  .. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.

. **Combine wet and dry**
  .. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture. Mix until just combined.
  .. Stir in the oats until evenly distributed.

. **Incorporate the chocolate**
  .. If using chunks, gently fold them into the dough.
  .. If melting the chocolate, drizzle it over the dough and lightly fold for a swirled effect.

. **Shape the cookies**
  .. Scoop approximately 1.5 tablespoons of dough and roll into balls.
  .. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving ~5 cm between each ball.
  .. Flatten slightly with your fingers or a spoon.

. **Bake**
  .. Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the edges are golden.
  .. The centers will still look soft—this is perfect for a chewy texture.

. **Cool**
  .. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes.
  .. Transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
