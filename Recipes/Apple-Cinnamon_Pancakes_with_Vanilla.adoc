. Mixing the Batter
.. Sift the 1 kg of mixed flours into a large mixing bowl.
.. Add 6 tbsp of cinnamon and a pinch of salt to the sifted flours.
.. Slowly pour in the 5 dl of oat milk while stirring, ensuring there are no lumps in the mixture.
.. Add 4 tbsp of maple syrup and 4 tsp of vanilla powder to the batter and mix well.

. Preparing Apples
.. Peel and core the 3 apples, then slice them into thin, half-inch slices.
.. Take the slices and coat them lightly with some cinnamon.

. Cooking Pancakes
.. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat.
.. Melt a small amount of the 200 g baking margarin on the pan.
.. Pour enough batter for a pancake about 1/4 inch thick onto the pan, then place some of the cinnamon-coated apple slices on top.
.. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake, then flip and cook until the other side is golden brown.
.. Repeat with the remaining batter and apple slices.

. Serving
.. Serve the pancakes hot.
.. Drizzle with extra maple syrup, and for an added touch of sweetness, consider a dollop of whipped cream or a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top.
