. **The Clunky Start (aka the sauce base)**
.. Heat a splash of sunflower oil in a saucepan.
.. Add _way too much_ potato starch and lightly brown it. *Donâ€™t panic* when it clumpsâ€”itâ€™s all part of the plan! :D
.. Stir in 1 carton of oat cream. This will create a (c)lumpy mixture. Embrace the chaos.

. **Sauce Building**
.. Add the tomato passata, crushed tomatoes, and some water. Stir well.
.. Pour in plenty of oat milk and stir vigorously. Congratulations, youâ€™ve created a "`primitive sauce!`" :D

. **SautÃ© Those Veggies**
.. In a separate pan, sautÃ© all fresh vegetables in a bit of oil.
.. Lightly brown the veggies for extra flavor.
... *NOTE:* If you have one, it might be good idea to ensure you have taken your ADHD medication before to avoid burning them. :D

. **The Great Blender Adventure**
.. Grab a stick blender (or regular blender). Combine:
... The contents of both pans (sauce + veggies).
... Chickpeas _with their liquid_.
.. Blend until smooth and silky. Itâ€™s officially declumpified _and_ full of nutritional ebin! :D

. **Final Touches**
.. Pour the puree back into the saucepan.
.. Bring it to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to just below boiling.
.. Stir in nutritional yeast. Add your spicesâ€”donâ€™t skimp! Adjust to taste as you go.
.. If itâ€™s still too thick, add more oat milk to thin it out.
.. Stir in the second carton of oat cream. _Extra creamy, anyone?_ :D
.. Let the whole thing simmer on low heat for about 20 minutes.
