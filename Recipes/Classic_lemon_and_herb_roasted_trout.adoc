= Classic Lemon and Herb Roasted Trout

== Ingredients:
- 1 whole trout (cleaned, about 300-400g)
- 1 lemon (sliced into thin rounds)
- Fresh herbs (e.g., parsley, dill, or thyme)
- 2-3 cloves of garlic (sliced)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt (about 1 teaspoon or to taste)
- Pepper (about 1/2 teaspoon or to taste)
- A few sprigs of rosemary (optional)

== Equipment:
- A baking sheet (large enough to hold the fish)
- Parchment paper or aluminium foil
- A sharp knife
- Kitchen scissors (optional for trimming)
- A cutting board
- Paper towels

== Step-by-Step Instructions:

=== Step 1: Preparing the Trout
. *Rinse the fish* under cold water to remove any debris or scales.
.. Run your hand gently along the fish skin to feel for any remaining scales. If you find any, use the back of a knife to scrape them off gently, moving from the tail to the head.
. *Pat the fish dry* using paper towels.
.. Drying is essential for getting crispy skin during roasting. Press gently on the surface of the fish to soak up any moisture.
. *Check the inside of the fish* to ensure it’s cleaned.
.. The fish should be gutted (with the insides removed). If not, you can ask the fishmonger to do this. If there are any leftover bits, carefully remove them with your fingers or a small knife.
. *Trim any fins* using kitchen scissors if needed.
.. If the fins are still attached, you can carefully snip them off. This step is optional but makes for a tidier presentation.

=== Step 2: Prepping the Fish for Roasting
. *Preheat your oven to 200°C*.
.. While the oven heats up, you can finish preparing the fish.
. *Score the skin of the trout* by making shallow slits on each side.
.. Use a sharp knife and make about 3-4 diagonal cuts on each side of the fish. These cuts should be shallow (about 0.5 cm deep) and spaced evenly along the fish’s body.
.. Scoring helps the fish cook evenly and lets the seasoning penetrate better.
. *Season the inside of the fish*.
.. Open the cavity of the fish (the belly where it was cleaned out) and sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper inside. This will add flavor from the inside out.
. *Stuff the fish with lemon and herbs*.
.. Insert lemon slices, a few garlic slices, and some sprigs of your chosen fresh herbs (like parsley, dill, or thyme) into the cavity.
.. You don’t need to overfill the fish, just enough to enhance the flavor.

=== Step 3: Preparing the Outside of the Fish
. *Brush the outside of the fish with olive oil*.
.. Pour about 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a small dish. Use a brush (or your hands if you don’t have one) to spread the oil all over the surface of the fish. Make sure both sides are coated evenly.
. *Season the skin*.
.. Sprinkle a bit more salt and pepper over the outside of the fish. This helps the skin become nice and crispy while roasting.
. *Add rosemary sprigs (optional)*.
.. If using rosemary, you can tuck a sprig or two into the slits you made in the skin or lay them on top of the fish.

=== Step 4: Preparing the Baking Sheet
. *Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminium foil*.
.. This will make cleaning up much easier and prevent the fish from sticking to the pan.
. *Place the fish on the prepared baking sheet*.
.. Lay the fish flat on the parchment or foil, making sure it’s centered and has enough space around it for even cooking.

=== Step 5: Roasting the Trout
. *Place the baking sheet in the oven* on the middle rack.
.. This will ensure even heat distribution.
. *Roast for 20-25 minutes*, depending on the size of the fish.
.. For a fish that weighs around 300-400g, it should take about 20-25 minutes. The skin should turn golden and crispy, and the fish should feel firm to the touch.
. *Check for doneness*.
.. You can test the fish by inserting a fork or knife into the thickest part of the fish (near the spine). If the flesh flakes easily and is opaque all the way through, it’s done.
.. If the fish isn’t quite cooked, give it a few more minutes and check again.

=== Step 6: Serving the Trout
. *Remove from the oven* and let it rest for a minute or two.
.. This will allow the juices to settle back into the fish and make it easier to serve.
. *Serve the fish whole* on a large plate.
.. You can garnish with extra lemon slices or a few fresh herbs for a beautiful presentation.
